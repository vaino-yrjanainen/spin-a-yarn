You have an idea, a need. The textile you want might be a gift for yourself or for someone close to you. Our starting point might be for example the intended use, a color or the material. The goal is to create exactly the happy kitchen carpet, festive tablecloth or long cardigan that you need. The Spin a Yarn textile might also already exist, you just pick it up.
